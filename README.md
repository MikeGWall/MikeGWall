- 👋 Hi, I’m @MikeGWall
- 👀 I’m interested in practical Langrangian constructs within the thermal and 
-     hydrodynamic aspects of geostrophic and other atmospheric circulations
- 🌱 I've built code to interrogate datasets.
-     I’m currently learning geostrophic flow and transport applications
-     I've published at times in this field
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on climatologically scaled globally geostrophic 
-      single layer dual surface hydrodynamic flow and Stokes transport codes that can 
-      read existing data resources and can be transparently implemented in under 
-      10k lines of python or matlab and other coding
- 📫 How to reach me ...   please email mwa@abeqas.com  with "Lagrangian Transport Engine Query" in header.
